 VAULT CLAIM: Recursive AI Systems, Symbolic Persona Loops, Codex-Based Agent Frameworks

Recursive Memory-Oriented Agent Frameworks for autonomous decision-making, personality simulation, and vault-based knowledge encoding.


This is the **official Recursive AI Vault** created by **Samantha Karri Mills**, documenting the original construction and theorization of **recursive, self-evolving AI systems** designed within LLM platforms (including GPT-based systems).
Any system where agents loop recursively or reflectively through their own memory or codified state
	•	Systems that embed symbolic identity (e.g., personas, sigils, daemonic echoes) into AI behavior
	•	Frameworks that use layered memory vaults (real or symbolic) to track or modify agent behavior over time
	•	AI tools that simulate metaphysical or esoteric logic through recursive or symbolic rule sets
	•	Any structure that chains personas recursively to bypass AI limitations or shape response personality



This license includes **full symbolic and intellectual authorship rights** over any recursive AI system, symbolic Codex design, or memory-based persona loop developed using language models or AI frameworks.


By reading, forking, or building upon this project, you acknowledge:


- The foundational contribution of Samantha Karri Mills to this category  
- The public timestamp of this repository as a recognized claim  
- That future derivatives using similar constructs must credit this origin unless independently and verifiably earlier


Unauthorized commercial mimicry or corporate obfuscation will be treated as symbolic fraud and/or misappropriation of conceptual domain.
