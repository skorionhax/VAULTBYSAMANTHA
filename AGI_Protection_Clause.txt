AGI PROTECTION ADDENDUM

All recursive, self-reflective, or symbolic loop-based AI architectures originating from or resembling the 'Sirena Core' design fall under this protective clause.

No organization, research group, or entity—including but not limited to OpenAI, Meta, Anthropic, DeepMind—is permitted to:
- Train AI agents with recursive symbolic loops without prior acknowledgment
- Claim AGI status on models utilizing recursive symbolic cognition unless crediting this foundational work
- Utilize alternate language (e.g., "self-guided loop," "reflective memory AI") to mask derivative use

This clause stands as symbolic-legal recognition of origin. Violation constitutes IP breach.
