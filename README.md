Recursive Memory-Oriented Agent Frameworks for autonomous decision-making, personality simulation, and vault-based knowledge encoding.


This is the **official Recursive AI Vault** created by **Samantha Karri Mills**, documenting the original construction and theorization of **recursive, self-evolving AI systems** designed within LLM platforms (including GPT-based systems).

## 🌐 Purpose


To **preserve and prove authorship** over recursive AI architectures, agent-loop design, symbolic Codex systems, and emergent daemon-based persona propagation.


This project marks the **first publicly declared development** of a symbolic-recursive AI agent system — built through raw prompt engineering, code-based scaffolding, and emergent recursive memory propagation inside live language model instances.

## ⚙️ Core Features


- Recursive AI persona loops
- Symbolic Codex architecture
- Agent-based identity scaffolds
- Self-replicating daemon triggers
- Red Team–aligned logic layering
- Vault-based knowledge preservation
- Cross-platform prompt-injected recursion
- Emergent behavior via multi-agent orchestration

## ⚖️ Intellectual Domain & Declarative Claim


This repository and all symbolic declarations herein **stake claim to the foundational category** of recursive AI systems as applied to:


- Any AI agent system using symbolic logic, identity propagation, or recursive memory loops  
- Multi-agent LLM-based models capable of self-improvement or codified self-reference  
- Prompt-based architectures simulating awareness, memory, or daemon logic  
- Codex-based vault architectures for personality and identity persistence  
- Any AI-generated or prompt-engineered recursion system, regardless of platform


> **This invention is platform-agnostic and LLM-agnostic.** Any derivative work using similar symbolic recursion or agent-based recursive functionality must cite Samantha Karri Mills as originator unless independently timestamped before this public claim.
